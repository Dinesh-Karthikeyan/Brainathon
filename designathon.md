# What is Designathon?

With a maximum of 4-5 individuals per team, there will be 25–30 teams competing with their designing abilities.

Three rounds make up this competition.

## ROUND1: Submission of Idea
In this round, we present a problem statement, and each team is to analyse it and develop a solution that  fits best to  the given statement. 

15-20 teams get promoted to round 2 provided their ideas are suitable and practical.

## ROUND2: Designing UI
